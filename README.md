# CafeBot
 The simplest Python Cafe Bot on Discord.

## What happened to CafeBot?
Originally owned and developed by Auxline and notsniped, the owner quit development and deleted her account, as well as CafeBot in the process.

As CafeBot cannot be hosted anymore (and since CafeBot's server is inactive), it has been migrated and archived with permission to NKA Development Group, and it will not be worked on unless the previous owner confirms.

### Will CafeBot ever come back?
CafeBot can be worked and improved on, however there isn't a userbase or demand anymore and thus, it will not be worked on unless the previous owner confirms continuation of development.

### Can I invite CafeBot to my server?
CafeBot cannot be invited to any server, and it probably won't be for a pretty long time. We will inform you if development starts again and we will provide an invite link here.
